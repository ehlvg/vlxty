# Veloxity

This is a simple frontend-only mock of a collaborative task management app using React and Vite. Data is stored in `localStorage` so the app works without a backend.

## Features
- Register/Login (mocked)
- Create multiple teams and projects
- Kanban board with customizable statuses and tasks
- Search tasks across projects
- Light/Dark theme switch and logout in settings

## Development
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
